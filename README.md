# -IOT-BASED-ARTIFICALLY-INTELLIGENT-DIAGNOSING-SMART-REFRIGERATOR
This project aims to create an IoT-enabled smart refrigerator equipped with artificial intelligence to monitor and diagnose key parameters of the refrigerator’s operation. The system provides real-time data about the refrigerator's components, ensuring optimal performance and safety. 
The **IoT-Based Artificially Intelligent Smart Refrigerator** project, developed between May 2023 and August 2023, focuses on creating an advanced refrigerator equipped with Internet of Things (IoT) technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor and diagnose key operational parameters. This system is designed to provide real-time data on the refrigerator’s performance, ensuring that it operates both efficiently and safely. Key features of the smart refrigerator include temperature monitoring, smoke detection, and circuit failure detection, all working in tandem to ensure optimal performance and safety for the appliance.
The smart refrigerator is outfitted with several essential sensors, such as temperature sensors to track the internal temperature, smoke detectors to identify potential fire hazards, and circuit failure sensors to detect issues like short circuits. These sensors are connected to a central microcontroller that processes the data and takes appropriate actions if any faults are detected. In addition, the microcontroller supports cloud connectivity via Wi-Fi, enabling secure remote access to the refrigerator’s data and status. This allows users to monitor the appliance from anywhere, ensuring they are always informed about its performance.
When a fault is detected—whether it's an over-temperature condition, smoke, or a circuit failure—the system automatically sends an alert to the cloud, notifying the user of the issue. In the case of a circuit failure, the refrigerator’s power supply is disconnected automatically, acting similarly to a circuit breaker (MCB), which helps prevent further damage. This feature helps ensure both the safety and longevity of the refrigerator.
Key features of the IoT-based smart refrigerator include continuous temperature monitoring to maintain optimal cooling, smoke detection for enhanced safety, a circuit failure sensor with an automatic power disconnection function (similar to an MCB), and cloud connectivity for remote monitoring and instant notifications. 
In conclusion, this IoT-enabled, AI-powered smart refrigerator enhances safety, convenience, and operational efficiency by providing continuous monitoring and real-time diagnostics. With cloud integration, users can remotely track the refrigerator’s status and receive immediate alerts, ensuring that any potential issues are promptly addressed. This innovative solution aims to improve the overall efficiency, safety, and longevity of refrigerators, making it an ideal option for both modern homes and businesses.
